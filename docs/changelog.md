- **Environment variables** for configuration changed

### Migration Guide v1.x ‚Üí v2.0.0

#### Configuration File
Old configuration files are automatically migrated on first run. If you have custom configurations:

```bash
# Backup your config
cp docker-pilot.config.json docker-pilot.config.json.backup

# Run migration
docker-pilot config --migrate

# Or reset and reconfigure
docker-pilot config --reset
```

#### Plugin Development
If you have custom plugins, update them to use the new i18n system:

```javascript
// Old way
console.log('Plugin executed');

// New way
console.log(this.i18n.t('plugin.executed'));
```

#### Environment Variables
Some environment variables changed:

```bash
# Old
export DOCKER_PILOT_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config

# New
export DOCKER_PILOT_CONFIG=/path/to/config
```

## Upgrade Instructions
